Superimpose schedules from SIS for teams to find mutually free timeslots. (For HKUST students)

To use:
Paste your schedule from SIS as a single line of text in any cell. 
Select the schedules you want to check, and press "Check Classes".

If you would like to see who are available at certain times, make sure their name is on the left of their schedule, select all schedules you want (do not select the names), then press "Check Available"

(You may change the text to a single line by pasting your schedule onto your web browser then copying the line without pressing enter).
